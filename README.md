R Code and Presentations of a summer REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) project done at Fresno State with my advisor Dr. Steve Chung. The R code here is just for NFL quarterback Tom Brady. Other quarterbacks had separate R files for each, all following the same format. Two PowerPoint presentations were given by me at Fresno State as part of a seminar, and those are shown here. A manuscript was co-written by my advisor and me, as well.
