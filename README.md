# 2015-Summer-Math-REU-Project
Gibbs sampling, Bayesian modeling, forecasting, MSE, MAD

R Code and Presentations of a summer REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) project done at Fresno State with my advisor Dr. Steve Chung. The goal was to predict fantasy football points for NFL quarterbacks, and three different models (two with a Bayesian framework, a third with a frequentist framework) were created to make those forecasts. Data sets were split into a "training" data set and a "testing" data set to evaluate model effectiveness. To judge each model between each other, MAD's (mean absolute deviation) and MSE's (mean squared error) were calculated. The R code shown here is just for NFL quarterback Tom Brady. Other quarterbacks had separate R files for each, all following the same format. Two PowerPoint presentations were given by me at Fresno State as part of a seminar, and those are shown here. A manuscript was co-written by my advisor and me, which is featured here.
